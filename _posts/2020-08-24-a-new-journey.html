        Dear Priyatham,
    </p>
    <br>
    <section id="intro">
        <p>
            As your PhD program begins in a week, I am writing you a letter that reflects on your journey so far and
            sets my expectations for future me; you. I understand that this journey you are about to embark on is a
            grueling experience fraught with uncertainty. I hope that this letter will never fail to fuel your spirit
            and will serve as a guiding beacon regardless of what life may throw at you.
        </p>
        <p>
            If all you have is a moment, remember <time datetime="2020-03-03">March 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2020</time>.
            Remember how you felt when you found out that you were going to be here:
        </p>

    </section>
    <section id="past">
        <h2>The Past</h2>
        <p>
            I know that you don't like to dwell on your past, but as George Santayana said,
        <blockquote>
            Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.
        </blockquote>
        So, here are three of your most expensive and influential lessons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The last eight years have been extremely trying for you, both personally and professionally. You
                    failed in many things. You failed many people, none more so than yourself. Ironically, you
                    failed the most when you were so afraid of failure that you didn't even try.
                    <strong>Never fear failure.</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You not only failed a lot, but you didn't learn from failure. This meta-failure ended up leaving
                    you so broke that you couldn't afford to eat more than one meal a day. Although hunger is one of the
                    greatest motivators, it is not fun to be always hungry.
                    <strong>Never repeat a failure.</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You went through all that, but that didn't stop you from getting to where you are today. If you can
                    start there and get here, you can start here and go anywhere.
                    <strong>Never lose hope.</strong>
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="future">
        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>
            No amount of contemplating the past will change anything unless you act and effective actions
            require deliberately set goals. Here's three that I have identified to be crucial for your success:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Health:</b> What can I say that has not already been said about the importance of health?
                    I hope that you are continuing to take good care of your physical health. But the real challenge is
                    to maintain a positive mental attitude. Always be mindful of how you are feeling and never hesitate
                    to reach out for help.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>Career:</b> You've always been in your element when you were solving a problem. So it's fitting
                    that you chose research as your career. But to achieve your career goals, you need to maintain
                    an impeccable work ethic, persevere, and manage time effectively.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <b>People:</b> This is perhaps your biggest shortcoming. Time and time again, studies have shown
                    that having meaningful relationships with people is the key to happiness. So never neglect your
                    relationships with your family, friends, peers, and mentors.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Though I wrote them as different categories, they are all strongly tied to each other. Improvement in one of
            these will have significant improvements in the other. Here are some examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Like I alluded to earlier, having good company is crucial for your mental health. You can always
                    lean on each other in times of distress.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    How people perceive you directly affects the kinds of career opportunities that you will get. So,
                    learn to communicate effectively. This blog was a great initiative; I hope you are writing
                    regularly.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you have a consistent and healthy routine, you can endure the long work hours
                    that a research career demands.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        I hope you will exploit this synergy in more ways than I can think of now and strive towards your all-round
        development.
