summary: "
The quality of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) image is largely determined by the scan rate of the electon beam.
Low scan rates produce high resolution images but take a long time. On the other hand, high scan rates are fast, but the
image quality is poor. Any downstream tasks (such as defect detection) are also affected by this tradeoff. To alleviate
this tradeoff, I synthesized a GAN-based super-resolving CNN that reproduces any defects in the input faithfully.
Interestingly, the outputs from this network perform better than even the ground truths, presumably, due to the
smoothing properties of the CNN. Jointly mentored by <a href=\"http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~raju/\">Prof. A N
